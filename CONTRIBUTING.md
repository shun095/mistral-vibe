## Development Setup

This section is for developers who want to set up the repository for local development, even though we're not currently accepting contributions.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Modern Python package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mistral-vibe
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync --all-extras
   ```

   This will install both runtime and development dependencies.

3. (Optional) Install pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

   Pre-commit hooks will automatically run checks before each commit.

### Logging Configuration

Logs are written to `~/.vibe/logs/vibe.log` by default. Control logging via environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`) | `WARNING` |
| `LOG_MAX_BYTES` | Max log file size in bytes before rotation | `10485760` (10 MB) |
| `DEBUG_MODE` | When `true`, forces `DEBUG` level | - |

Example:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG uv run vibe
```

### Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run tests with verbose output:

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

Run a specific test file:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_agent_tool_call.py
```

### Linting and Type Checking

#### Ruff (Linting and Formatting)

Check for linting issues (without fixing):

```bash
uv run ruff check .
```

Auto-fix linting issues:

```bash
uv run ruff check --fix .
```

Format code:

```bash
uv run ruff format .
```

Check formatting without modifying files (useful for CI):

```bash
uv run ruff format --check .
```

#### Pyright (Type Checking)

Run type checking:

```bash
uv run pyright
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

Run all pre-commit hooks manually:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

The pre-commit hooks include:

- Ruff (linting and formatting)
- Pyright (type checking)
- Typos (spell checking)
- YAML/TOML validation
- Action validator (for GitHub Actions)

### Code Style

- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black-compatible)
- **Type hints**: Required for all functions and methods
- **Docstrings**: Follow Google-style docstrings
- **Formatting**: Use Ruff for both linting and formatting
- **Type checking**: Use Pyright (configured in `pyproject.toml`)

See `pyproject.toml` for detailed configuration of Ruff and Pyright.
